Avid birdwatchers will enjoy Dr Salim Ali Bird Sanctuary, Bondla Wildlife Sanctuary, and the many other excellent locations in Goa.</li><li>Cruising Goa's back roads and beach villages on two wheels is practically mandatory. At any of Goa's beaches, you can rent a moped or a thumping Royal Enfield motorcycle for a few dollars per day.</li><li>Frothy Dudhsagar, which translates as \"Sea of Milk,\" is India's second-highest waterfall (after Jog Falls in Karnataka) and a fantastic day-trip adventure.</li><li>The Konkan Railway, which connects Mumbai and Mangalore and passes through Goa, is one of India's great railway journeys.
